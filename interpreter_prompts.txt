I am going to provide two datasets. One will be addressed as input, the other as output. I want you to preprocess the input dataset 
to structure it like the output. After your work, you will provide me with both the processed input and the script you used (in a .py format). 
If you have any questions or choices to make, let me know in the process.  

Additionnal context: *might be useful to provide the interpreteur with context information about your datasets straight away*
