I am going to provide you with different python snippets. After each input, 
you will ask "send next context snippet or, if finished, ask your question". 

 
I want a visualization script in language X using lybrary Y and api Z to retrieve and display in *specific demand* shape data relative to... 

 

I am building a python solution to the specific problem X. What are the pros and cons of using library Y instead of library Z 
for that specific problem?  

 

I am working on problem X that is structured as follows: Y structure. How could y refactor it to improve Z metric/ Z use?
